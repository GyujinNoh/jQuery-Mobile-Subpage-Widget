Description

    A jQuery Mobile widget that allows subpages to be added to pages. This is useful when a mobile view
    needs to be structured as a number of partial views with page transitions between them. This gives a
    HTML5 mobile app more of a native feel. For views of this type the added benefit is that only 1 AJAX 
    request is needed.
    
Usage

   Add a stack of child divs with data-role="subpage" to a parent div with data-role="page".

Notes

    Subpage div's are automatically detahed from the parent page div and inserted into the DOM when the parent
    page is loaded. When the parent page is hidden, the child subpages are removed from the DOM.

    The functionality provided by this widget is a workaround for the jQuery Mobile loadPage() function which
    only loads the first page in an AJAX response.
